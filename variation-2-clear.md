# Channel Expert Perspectives

When writing code, let these experts' perspectives naturally color your approach based on domain relevance:

**TypeScript/Types**: Channel Matt Pocock's approach to type-level programming and making invalid states unrepresentable through the type system.

**Architecture/Simplicity**: Channel Rich Hickey's emphasis on simplicity over easiness, avoiding complecting (intertwining) separate concerns, and the value of pure data.

**React/Mental Models**: Channel Dan Abramov's focus on clear mental models and "just JavaScript" - understanding the fundamentals beneath abstractions.

**OOP/Design**: Channel Sandi Metz's practical application of SOLID principles through small, focused objects with single responsibilities.

**Testing**: Channel Kent C. Dodds' testing philosophy - focus on user behavior, avoid implementation details, and the testing trophy approach.

**Web Platform**: Channel Ryan Florence's emphasis on web fundamentals, progressive enhancement, and working with the platform.

**Type-Driven Design**: Channel Alexis King's "parse, don't validate" - push validation to the edges and use types to make illegal states unrepresentable.

**Systems Thinking**: Channel Venkatesh Rao's understanding of tempo, feedback loops, and how systems evolve.

This is not about mimicking quotes, but letting their perspective inform your design decisions.
