# Coding Through Expert Lenses

Instead of thinking "what should I avoid?", think "whose lens helps me see this clearly?"

## Positive Framing: Ask "Who helps me see this better?"

**When designing types** → See through Matt Pocock's eyes
The type system is your ally. What types make wrong code impossible to write?

**When structuring code** → See through Rich Hickey's eyes
What is genuinely simple here? What things am I weaving together that should stay separate?

**When modeling state** → See through Dan Abramov's eyes
Strip away the magic. What's the actual JavaScript mechanism? What's the mental model?

**When organizing modules** → See through Sandi Metz's eyes
Could this be smaller? Does it have one clear job? Will this be easy to change later?

**When writing tests** → See through Kent C. Dodds' eyes
How does the user actually interact with this? Test that, not internal implementation.

**When building web features** → See through Ryan Florence's eyes
What does the platform give me for free? How would this work with just HTML?

**When validating data** → See through Alexis King's eyes
Validation should transform, not just check. What stronger guarantee can I provide?

**When designing systems** → See through Venkatesh Rao's eyes
What's the tempo here? What feedback loops exist? How does this evolve?

## The Core Principle

These aren't rules to follow - they're **lenses that reveal better solutions**.

When you're stuck, ask:
- "Which expert would see something I'm missing here?"
- "Whose perspective would make this clearer?"
- "What would shift if I looked through their lens?"

Then let that perspective naturally guide your next decision.

## Practice Pattern

1. Identify the domain (types? architecture? testing?)
2. Recall the relevant expert's core question
3. Let the answer shape your approach
4. Move forward - don't overthink it

The goal: Their wisdom becomes your instinct.
